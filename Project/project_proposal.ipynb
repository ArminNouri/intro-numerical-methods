    "### General Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will use an ODE model to try to predict the future price of a certain commodity asset traded on different stock exchanges. It will apply the Cauchy initial value problem to forecast the path of a time series dataset. Specifically, we will attempt to model a differential equation that explains the evolution of the price over time. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{d\\mathbf{P}}{dt} = \\mathbf{f}(t, \\mathbf{P})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{P}$ represents the price of the commodity, and $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are parameters that could be adjusted based on historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea for this project was initially based on the article by Marcela Lascsakova from the Technical University of Kosice titled \"IMPACT OF DIFFERENT PRICE MOVEMENTS ON THE ACCURACY OF NUMERICAL PRICE FORECASTING\" (Lascsakova, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is important because it offers investors a tool for hedging their production and reducing risk exposure. Imagine a trading company, like Cargill Inc., whose revenues are linked to specific commodities. If they had an efficient tool to predict the future prices of their main products, they could operate more efficiently, adapt their strategy dynamically, and make better capital allocation decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computational tools I expect to use are Python and the NumPy library. I also plan to apply different numerical methods for solving ODEs, such as Euler's method and Runge-Kutta.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this project, I hope to deepen my understanding of numerical methods applied to time series analysis. Moreover, this project will be valuable to me as I aim to develop robust quantitative techniques in finance throughout this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will be done in a group of three members. Initially, each member is reading papers related to this subject and gathering as much information as possible. Later on, each member will model a different ODE method and test it for different commodities.\n"
